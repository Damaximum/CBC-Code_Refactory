# 02 Homework for UCSD Coding Bootcamp

This code is for the homework assignment of week 2 in Coding Bootcamp.
It is a test site given for the homework.

The objective of the homework was to learn and practice HTML and CSS as well as refactoring.

This site has been refactored to the best of my ability to meet the requirements and the demo picture that was provided with the homework.
